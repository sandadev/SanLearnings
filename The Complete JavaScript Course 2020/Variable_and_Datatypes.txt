Variable and Datatype:
=========================

Variable : Its a container in which we can store a value in order to use it over and over 
to use the value.

ex:-var firstName ='Jhon';

Different Datatype in Javascript
=================================

Number : Floating point numbers,for decimal and integers.
String : Sequence of character user for text.
Boolean: Logical datatypes that can be a true and false.
Undefined:Datatype of a Variable that doesn't have a value yet.
Null: Also means non-existent.

*** Number will have always decimal ex: Number i=5; 5.0

*** Javascript always have a dynamic typing.

var name ='jhon' -- valid
var age=20 ---- valid
var isEmployee =true ---- valid

note :

if we want to declare a variable has below need to be add _ or $ it will work

var 3years =3 -----not valid
var _3years=3 ----- valid
var $3years =3 ----- valid
